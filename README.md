### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name's Renato JiquiriÃ§Ã¡ Ramos, I am from Rio de Janeiro - Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·) and I have been working with backend development for many years, mostly with Java and the last year with Spring. I also have experience with other technologies.

I am currently starting a new challenge as Software Developer at [B2W Digital](https://ri.b2w.digital) which is one of the biggest players in the Brazilian and South American retail market. My main responsibility is to automate the process of managing users, and profiles, in different systems through integrations using APIs.

I passionate about solving problems and I love the opportunity to develop systems that can be reliable, scalable, functional, and that can help businesses to be successful. This is very relevant for me and makes me love this job, it's an area without monotony due to constant evolution.

I am a person who always likes to be learning new technologies, despite more experience with backend, I am currently studying React, improving my knowledge with Spring, Spring Boot, JPA, and at the same time studying more in detail MongoDB.

In my free time I like to enjoy the family, which I love, we love to see a good movie or series. Personally I love to practice sports like cycling, basketball, volleyball, but I also love water activities like scuba diving and sailing.


#### Current Personal Projects

#### React:
  - [ReFlix](https://reflix.vercel.app): Responsive web application in NetFlix format for learning React and its concepts.
