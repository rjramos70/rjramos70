### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name's Renato JiquiriÃ§Ã¡ Ramos, I am from Rio de Janeiro - Brazil (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·) and I have been working with backend development for many years, mostly with Java, and for the past few years with Spring stack. I also have experience with other technologies.

I am a Senior Developer with more than 22 years of experience in the IT sector, I have worked with several technologies and business areas, and one of the points that technology attracts me the most is that we always have the opportunity to learn.

I am passionate about solving problems and love the opportunity to develop systems that can be reliable, scalable, and functional, and help businesses succeed. This is very relevant for me and makes me love this job, an area without monotony.

Experience developing projects based on requirements, budgets, and deadlines, with great experience in web applications using Java, and Spring stack. Great experience with SQL language and relational databases like Oracle, MySQL, SQL Server, and NoSQL databases like MongoDB, and knowledge of REST APIs.

Would you like to find me?
